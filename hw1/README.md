# Homework 1

This homework is the first part of a three-part homework sequence in which you 
will build a calculator application. For this first assignment, you will only 
build the front end user interface for the calculator. In the later assignments 
you will make the calculator work. 

## Specifications

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The calculator will contain 15 clickable buttons: a button for each digit 0 to 9, and +, -, ×, ÷, and =
* [X] Buttons must have rounded corners.
* [X] Digit buttons must by a different color than other buttons.
* [X] Your calculator should display a single integer value that
the user may not directly edit. For this homework, the value
is zero.
* [X] When the user hovers over a button, its color must change.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Requirements

Your submission must also follow these requirements:

● You must have some design and general theme used throughout your page using CSS and
HTML. (I.e., your UI should look consistent in terms of layout, colors, etc.)

● You must submit one HTML file called calculator.html.

● The CSS must be separated out into (one or more) static file(s).

● You may not use images in your calculator.

● You must write the CSS and HTML yourself. You may not include packages from other sources
(such as Bootstrap, for example). You may not use JavaScript for this homework assignment.

● Cite all external resources used and any additional notes you would like to convey to your grader in the README.md file.

usage of HTML and CSS.
